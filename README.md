Cars classification base on  standford cars datasets and my TH cars datasets.

Objective
---------
I'm working on requires obtaining a high percentage from the classification. Initially, it will refer to existing research, starting with the Stanford Cars Datasets to compare classification accuracy of different trial models. I'll then compare it with previous research to see if they align closely. Finally, I'll use my own collected data, focusing on Thai car models, to assess the classification percentage.
